# How To Convert An HTML File To PDF With Pandoc

This tutorial covers how to use Pandoc to convert an HTML file to a PDF. Using Pandoc is not recommended, because it doesn't preserve everything.

## Steps

### Installing Pandoc On Debian 12
- In terminal type "sudo apt-get install pandoc texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-recommended".

### Convert HTML to PDF
- In terminal type "pandoc '/path/to/source.html' -t latex --pdf-engine '/usr/bin/pdflatex' -o '/path/to/destination.pdf'

## Notes

- This tutorial only covers installation of Pandoc on Debian 12.
- This tutorial was tested on Debian 12 AMD64 XFCE.
- This method may not preserve some things during conversion (e.g., fonts).

# How To Convert An HTML File To PDF With Firefox

This tutorial covers how to use Firefox to convert an HTML file to a PDF. It is done manually.

## Steps

### Installing Firefox On Debian 12

- In terminal type "sudo apt-get install firefox-esr". This will install the ESR version of Firefox.

### Convert HTML to PDF

- In your file-manager, browse to the HTML file, right-click on it, choose "Open With", choose "Open with another application", select Firefox, and click "Open". Depending on your file-manager of choice, the options may be listed slightly differently.
- In Firefox, go to "File", choose "Print", under "Destination" choose "Save to PDF", and click "Save".

## Notes

- This tutorial only covers installation of Firefox ESR on Debian 12.
- This tutorial was tested on Debian 12 AMD64 XFCE.
- When printing to PDF you may want to adjust the margin options to zero, and the background colour settings to preserve background colours.
